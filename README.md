# Schnapsen
A full 1-player card game called [Schnapsen](http://psellos.com/schnapsen/rules.html) in HTML5 Canvas.
Still a WIP, I've implemented basic ui, card handling, and AI, but many things are still broken.
To run, simply open the index.html file in an HTML5-compatible browser.

Thanks to jfitz.com for providing a 52 card sprite sheet that the card image is derived from.
